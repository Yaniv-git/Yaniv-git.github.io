## Impact
Vendure is an e-commerce GraphQL framework with a number of APIs and different levels of
authorization. By default the Cookie settings are insecure, having the SameSite setting as false
which results in not having one (originates from the cookie-session npm packageâ€™s default
settings).

# Patches
Update to versions 2.0.3 or above.

# Workarounds
Manually set the `authOptions.cookieOptions.sameSite` configuration option to `'strict'`, `'lax'` or `true`.
