# Who am I?

Starting my way as a Software Engineer, I transitioned into the realm of Cyber-Security during my service in the IDF's 8200 unit, where I gained experience in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity tactics. Since entering the industry as a Security Researcher, my primary area of expertise now centers on conducting hands-on research related to cod, where I had the privilege of sharing my findings with the broader cybersecurity community.
